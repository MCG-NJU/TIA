---
Liang Zhao, Limin Wang

This repository is the official PyTorch implementation of paper Task-specific Inconsistency Alignment for Domain Adaptive Object Detection. (The work has been accepted by CVPR2022)

## Main requirements
torch == 1.0.0
torchvision == 0.2.0
Python 3
faster-rcnn

<!-- ## Environmental settings
This repository is developed using python 3.6.7 on Ubuntu 16.04.5 LTS. The CUDA nad CUDNN version is 9.0 and 7.4.1 respectively. We use one NVIDIA 1080ti GPU card for training and testing. Other platforms or GPU cards are not fully tested. -->

## Pretrain models
The pretrain backbone (vgg, resnet) and pretrain model (TIA) will be released soon.
